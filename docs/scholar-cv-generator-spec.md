# SPEC — Scholar → WCM CV generator (/edit Tools section)

**Status:** Draft for review (decisions locked 2026-06-26) · **Branch:** `docs/scholar-cv-generator-spec` (worktree off `origin/master` @ `bce4f527`)
**Research:** 4-agent workflow over CViche + SPS `origin/master`; POPS API probed live 2026-06-26.

---

## 1. Goal

Add a tool to the individual-scholar `/edit` **Tools** section — labelled **"CV (WCM format)"** —
that exports the scholar's structured Scholars data (enriched with POPS for clinical faculty) as a
Word `.docx` in the **WCM faculty CV format**: the same output CViche produces, but built from
clean structured data instead of parsing an arbitrary Word doc.

## 2. Locked decisions

1. **Rendering — reconstruct the WCM layout in code with the `docx` lib** (already a dependency).
   No new deps. Faithfully match WCM section order, table columns, and headings; **preserve the
   scholar's surname bolded inside each citation** (parity with CViche). It is a code replica of
   the template — if WCM revises the official template, the builder must be updated to match.
2. **Research summary (M1) — generate anew** each time via the existing overview/Bedrock path
   (`lib/edit/overview-generator.ts`); inherits its anti-hallucination grounding.
3. **Audience — same as biosketch:** `authorizeOverviewWrite` (self · superuser · granted proxy ·
   org-unit owner/curator).
4. **Rail label — "CV (WCM format)".**

## 3. The honest framing

A **partial pre-fill**, not a finished CV. The WCM template is 23 sections.

- **Research/PhD faculty:** Scholars fills the research spine (bibliography, grants, research
  summary, mentoring, appointments, education, leadership); clinical/service/teaching/honors
  sections are `N/A`.
- **Clinical faculty (have a POPS profile):** POPS additionally fills board certification, residency/
  fellowship training, hospital appointments+affiliation, honors, NPI, and corroborates degrees —
  a much fuller CV.

`N/A` placeholders are emitted for every section lacking data, which is exactly what the WCM
template's own instruction box mandates (*sections must not be deleted; enter "N/A"*). Sell it as
**"pre-fill the WCM CV from your Scholars (and clinical) data, then complete the rest"** — not
"generate my CV."

## 4. What we reuse (why this is small)

| Need | Already in SPS | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Emit a `.docx` (with bold runs) | `docx@^9.6.1` already installed; `word-bibliography.ts` builds bold-author Vancouver citations | `package.json`, `lib/api/word-bibliography.ts` |
| Stream a `.docx` download | working route | `app/(public)/scholars/[slug]/co-pubs/export/route.ts` |
| Scholar feedstock | `assembleOverviewFacts()` + `getScholarFullProfileBySlug()` | `lib/edit/overview-facts.ts`, `lib/api/profile.ts` |
| M1 research summary (LLM) | overview generator + Bedrock path + grounding | `lib/edit/overview-generator.ts` |
| Tool authz | `authorizeOverviewWrite` | `lib/edit/overview-authz.ts` |
| Card / route / flag pattern | biosketch tool (`#917`) — the copy/export analog | `components/edit/biosketch-tool.tsx`, `app/api/edit/biosketch/*` |
| Request preamble + download | `readEditRequest`, `editOk`, origin guard, 64KB cap | `lib/edit/request.ts` |

A CV from structured data is **deterministic**, so we skip biosketch's NDJSON streaming,
prompt-versioning, and Prisma persistence. Net new: a data→sections builder, a POPS fetch/mapper,
a download card, and the standard edit-page registration.

## 5. Coverage matrix — WCM section → source → fill

Order = official template (`wcm_cv_template_faculty_october_2022_final.docx`, matched 1:1 by CViche
`stage_6_word_template.py:972-993`). **S = Scholars, P = POPS (clinical only), L = LLM, NA = `N/A`.**

| # | WCM section | Scholars | POPS enrichment (if `hasClinicalProfile`) | Fill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Header / signature | `publishedName`; Date = today; Signature blank | — | **S** |
| 2 | Personal Data | name; `email` iff visible | `npi_number`, professional suffixes | **S (partial)** |
| 3 | Education — Degrees (B1) | `Education` (degree/inst/year) | `degrees[]` (degree_type/year_obtained/institution) corroborates | **S+P** |
| 4 | Education — Other (B2) | rare | — | **NA** |
| 5 | Postdoctoral Training (C) | **`Education` training rows (ASMS; inconsistent)** | `training[]` supplements (Residency/Fellowship + institution; *no dates*) | **S+P** |
| 6 | Professional Positions (D1/D2/D3) | `Appointment` (WCM/NYP) | **`appointments[]`** (title + institution + term dates) → D2 hospital | **S+P** |
| 7 | Employment Status | — | — | **NA** |
| 8 | Licensure (F1) / **Board Cert (F2)** | — | F1: `npi_number` only. **F2: `board_certifications[]`** (board_name + specialty; *no cert#/dates*) | **P (F2); NA (F1 dates)** |
| 9 | Hospital Affiliation | **primary affiliation (ASMS — confirm loader)** | primary NYP `appointment` | **S+P** |
| 10 | **Honors, Awards (H)** | — (ASMS source unconfirmed) | **`honors_and_awards`** (HTML blob; light parse) | **P** |
| 11 | Society Memberships (I) | — | — | **NA** |
| 12 | Percent Effort | — | — | **NA** |
| 13 | Educational Contributions (K1–K5) | — | — | **NA** |
| 14 | Clinical Practice/Innovation/Leadership (L1–L3) | `clinicalProfileUrl` only | specialties / `problem_procedure` expertise (optional list) | **P (partial) / NA** |
| 15 | **Research Activities — summary (M1)** | `assembleOverviewFacts` | (POPS bio as optional grounding) | **L (generate anew)** |
| 16 | **Research Support — grants (M2A/B/C)** + Patents | `Grant` rows by status; **no `$` amounts**; pending not modeled | — (external grants → RePORTER companion, §9) | **S (grants); NA (patents)** |
| 17 | **Mentoring (N3A/N3B)** | `getMenteesForMentor()` — **FERPA carve** | — | **S** |
| 18 | Institutional Leadership (O) | leadership FK (Chair/Chief/Director); current only | — | **S (partial)** |

| 20 | Extramural Service / Editorial (Q1–Q4) | — | — | **NA** |
| 21 | Invitations to Speak (R) | — | — | **NA** |
| 22 | **Bibliography (S1/S2…)** | full `Publication` corpus; PMID-only → S3 Books/S4 Chapters empty | — | **S (reuse `word-bibliography.ts`, bold author)** |
| 23 | Appendix (T) | — | — | skip |

## 6. POPS enrichment (clinical faculty)

**Source (probed live 2026-06-26, HTTP 200):** `http://pops.weillcornell.org/providerbyshortname/{cwid}.json`
— **cwid lookup confirmed** (our join key; the path also accepts publish_short_name). `providerprofiles/ids.json`
is just 5,869 internal numeric ids — not needed. `providerProfile` has 57 fields; verified mappings:

| POPS field | shape (verified) | → WCM |
|---|---|---|
| `board_certifications[]` | `{board_name, mapped_specialty.name}` — **no cert#, no dates** | F2 |
| `training[]` | `{training_type, institution}` — **no dates**; types incl Residency/Internship/Fellowship/Medical School | C (drop "Medical School" rows; redundant with degrees) |
| `degrees[]` | `{degree_type, year_obtained, institution, is_hidden}` | B1 |
| `appointments[]` | `{title, institution, termstartdate, termenddate, is_hidden}` — **real ISO dates** | D1/D2 + §9 |
| `honors_and_awards` | single HTML string (`<p><strong>date</strong> award</p>`) | H |
| `npi_number` / `has_npi_number` | string | F1 (NPI sub-field) |
| `primary_specialties` / `problem_procedure` | specialty + expertise lists | L (optional) |
| `biography` / `personal_statement` | HTML | optional M1 grounding |

**Mechanism:** fetch-at-generation, **zero-persist** (no new tables/ETL) — one GET keyed by cwid,
only when `Scholar.hasClinicalProfile` is true; handle 404/empty as "no enrichment." Same
enrichment pattern as the RePORTER grants companion (§9).

**Source precedence (POPS supplements, doesn't replace, Scholars-native data):** prefer ASMS-sourced
Scholars data where it exists — **C postdoctoral training** (`Education` training rows) and
**§9 primary affiliation** both have an ASMS source (already in-app + suppression-aware); POPS fills
gaps/corroborates there. POPS is **primary** only for **F2 board certifications** (no ASMS/Scholars
equivalent), NPI, and (tentatively) **H honors**. Merge rule: ASMS rows first, append POPS rows not
already present (dedup by institution+type/year).

**Caveats (build for these):**
- Booleans are **strings** (`'True'`/`'False'`/`'None'`) — coerce.
- Respect row-level **`is_hidden`** (degrees/appointments) → exclude, consistent with our
  suppression-honoring principle.
- Board certs & training carry **no dates** → those columns render blank, not fabricated.
- `honors_and_awards` is **unstructured HTML** — v1 heuristic: split per `<p>`, strip tags,
  pull a leading year/date into the Date column, rest → award name, Organization `N/A`. *Known
  ceiling; complex entries fall back to the whole line in the award column.*
- **Connectivity — CONFIRMED:** POPS is reachable from outside the WCM network, so the SPS app
  fetches it at generation over the internet (NAT egress); no ETL/proxy needed. (Notable since the
  Sps VPCs cannot reach WCM 10.x internal sources — POPS is the public physician-directory host.)

## 6b. POPS data transparency — preview in /edit (NOT the public profile)

**Requirement (user 2026-06-26):** the POPS-sourced clinical data the CV pulls must be **visible to
the scholar in the `/edit` surface**, with plain-language copy on how it's used, so they can see
what will land in their CV. It must **not** be added to the public Scholars profile.

- **Where:** a read-only "Clinical credentials (from POPS)" preview inside the **CV (WCM format)**
  tool card (default — co-located with where the data is used). Alternative: a standalone "Clinical"
  card in the Tools rail (same data, own panel). Embedded is the lazy default; standalone if you
  want it discoverable on its own.
- **What it shows:** the fetched `PopsEnrichment` — board certifications, residency/fellowship
  training, hospital appointments (with dates), honors, NPI, specialties — each tagged with the CV
  section it feeds (F2 / C / D2·§9 / H / F1).
- **Copy (verbatim intent):** "These clinical credentials come from your WCM physician profile
  (POPS) and are used to fill your CV's board-certification, training, hospital-appointment, and
  honors sections. They're shown here so you can see what will be included — they are **not** added
  to your public Scholars profile."
- **Empty / non-clinical:** scholars without `hasClinicalProfile` (or an empty POPS record) → show
  nothing, or "No WCM physician (POPS) profile found."
- **Mechanism:** a small `GET /api/edit/cv/pops?cwid=` returning the typed `PopsEnrichment` (+ a
  per-field → CV-section map) for display; **same `authorizeOverviewWrite` gating** as the CV tool;
  reuses `fetchPops` (no new data path). **Never rendered under `app/(public)/scholars/...`.**
- **Status:** v1.1 follow-up, layered on the base build (which already produces `fetchPops` + the CV
  card). Not part of the in-flight base build.

## 7. Architecture / data flow

```
POST /api/edit/cv?cwid=<target>         (mirror biosketch route shape; download response)
  └─ readEditRequest()                  reuse (origin guard, session, 64KB cap)
  └─ authorizeOverviewWrite()           reuse (self|superuser|proxy|org-unit owner)
  └─ flag isCvEnabled() else 404
  └─ assembleOverviewFacts() + profile loaders         reuse (pubs, grants, education, appts, mentees, leadership)
  └─ if hasClinicalProfile: fetchPops(cwid)            NEW (zero-persist; board cert, training, appts, honors, npi)
  └─ M1 = generateResearchSummary(facts)               reuse overview-generator Bedrock path (always regenerate)
  └─ buildWcmCv(facts, pops, summary) -> docx.Document  NEW: reconstruct 23 sections, N/A where empty
         · bibliography reuses word-bibliography.ts (bold author)               reuse
  └─ Packer.toBuffer(doc) -> attachment                reuse pattern
```

M1 adds a single Bedrock call (a few seconds) → the card shows a "Generating…" state; **no NDJSON
streaming needed** for v1 (one short generation). Add streaming later only if it feels slow.

## 8. New & touched files

**New (4):**
- `lib/edit/cv-export.ts` — `buildWcmCv(facts, pops, summary)`: deterministic section mapping →
  WCM layout via `docx` (reuse `word-bibliography.ts` for the bibliography); `N/A` placeholders.
- `lib/edit/pops.ts` — `fetchPops(cwid)`: GET + parse + coerce string-booleans + honor `is_hidden`
  + map to a typed `PopsEnrichment`. Returns null on 404/no-profile/unreachable (never throws into
  the CV path — enrichment is best-effort).
- `app/api/edit/cv/route.ts` — flag → `readEditRequest` → `authorizeOverviewWrite` → assemble →
  POPS → M1 → `buildWcmCv` → `Packer.toBuffer` attachment.
- `components/edit/cv-tool.tsx` — "Download CV (WCM format)" button + a checklist of which sections
  were filled vs left `N/A` (sets expectations honestly).

**Edit (standard registration — same as biosketch):**
- `components/edit/edit-page.tsx` — `AttrKey`, `ATTRIBUTES`, rail order/placement maps
  (SELF/SUPERUSER/RAIL_V2 → group "Tools"), `EditPageProps` flag, `visible` filter, `renderPanel()` case.
- `app/edit/page.tsx` + `app/edit/scholar/[cwid]/page.tsx` — read `isCvEnabled()` and thread the
  boolean (**flag parity — both pages** or it silently ships off, [[feedback_flag_parity_local_vs_deployed]]).
- `cdk/.../app-stack.ts` — wire `EDIT_CV_EXPORT` per-env (staging-first) + a `POPS_BASE_URL` env;
  then **regenerate the cdk snapshot** (`cd cdk && npm ci && npm test -- -u`,
  [[feedback_cdk_appstack_snapshot_regen]]).

**No** Prisma model, **no** versions panel, **no** streaming for v1.

## 9. Grants gap → RePORTER companion

`Grant` rows are WCM-administered only → external/prior-institution NIH grants are missing. A
companion spec (`docs/reporter-grants-matcher-spec.md`, current working tree) backfills these from
NIH RePORTER via the **same fetch-at-generation, zero-persist** pattern as POPS. The CV's Research
Support section sources `Grant` rows in v1 and can layer the RePORTER backfill when that ships.
Still no dollar amounts (neither source exposes them to us).

## 10. Authz, visibility, gating (do not simplify away)

- Reuse `authorizeOverviewWrite` verbatim (keyed on `realCwid`, never the impersonated session).
- **FERPA / mentees:** honor the doctoral-student/mentee visibility carve; don't emit suppressed mentees.
- **Email** only if `emailVisibility` permits.
- **Suppression / `field_override`:** build on `profile.ts` projections so hidden pubs/grants/appts stay hidden.
- **POPS `is_hidden`** rows excluded (above).
- **Internal-only, never on the CV:** `PublicationTopic.score` ([[project_topic_score_is_internal]]),
  per-pub impact score/justification, faculty bibliometrics.

## 11. Scope — v1 vs later

**v1:** download `.docx`; deterministic Scholars fill (ASMS-first); POPS enrichment (board cert /
training / hospital appts+affiliation / honors / NPI / degrees) gated on `hasClinicalProfile`
(egress confirmed, §6); M1 generated anew; reconstruct-in-code renderer; flag `EDIT_CV_EXPORT` staging-first.

**Defer:** RePORTER external-grant backfill (§9) · saved CV versions/history · letting the scholar
paste back the still-empty sections (memberships, service, talks, committees) · PDF variant ·
pending-grant (M2C) · richer honors HTML parsing.

**Won't do (no source anywhere):** society memberships, committees, extramural/editorial service,
invited talks, teaching/courses, patents, grant dollar amounts, books/chapters, employment status.

## 12. One runnable check

`tests/unit/cv-export.test.ts`: build the CV for two fixtures — a research-only scholar and a
clinical scholar (with a POPS payload) — and assert: (a) all 23 WCM headings present **in order**;
(b) every empty section renders the `N/A` placeholder (no silent drop); (c) bibliography contains
the scholar's **bolded** surname; (d) a suppressed publication/mentee and a POPS `is_hidden` row do
**not** appear; (e) the clinical fixture's board certification renders in F2.

## 13. Remaining decisions for the user

1. **ASMS loaders for C & §9:** the code research found C training rows in `Education` (ASMS,
   inconsistent) but attributed appointments to ED/NYP, not an explicit ASMS *primary-affiliation*
   field — confirm the exact ASMS loader/field for primary affiliation during implementation.
2. **POPS honors depth:** ship the simple per-`<p>` heuristic for §H in v1, or leave H as `N/A`
   until a structured honors source is confirmed (ASMS honors unconfirmed)?
3. **Clinical expertise (L):** list POPS specialties/`problem_procedure` in the Clinical Practice
   section, or leave L `N/A` (it expects prose practice entries POPS doesn't provide)?
