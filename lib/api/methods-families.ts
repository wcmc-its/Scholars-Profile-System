/**
 * Comms-steward Method-Family roster (server-side builder) —
 * `docs/comms-steward-methods-visibility-spec.md` §7.
 *
 * One join across the four family surfaces — distinct `(supercategory,
 * family_label)` in `scholar_family`, the #800 suppression overlay, the #801
 * sensitivity overlay, and the `family_review_flag` surfacing ledger — projected
 * into a flat roster the steward UI table (and the CSV export) render. Keyed
 * everywhere on the STABLE `(supercategory, family_label)` identity via
 * {@link familyOverlayKey}; the re-mintable `family_id` never appears.
 *
 * The `tier` is derived from overlay membership, NOT a stored column: a family in
 * the suppression overlay is "suppressed"; one in the sensitivity overlay is
 * "sensitive"; one in neither is "public" (the default — no overlay row). This is
 * the same precedence the audit SQL (§14) and the query-time resolver use:
 * suppression wins over sensitivity if a family were ever (incorrectly) in both,
 * matching the `loadFamilyOverlayGate` "suppressed first" check.
 *
 * Server-only (queries Prisma); the route handlers gate auth + the
 * `COMMS_STEWARD_ENABLED` flag before calling this builder, which trusts its
 * inputs and only assembles data.
