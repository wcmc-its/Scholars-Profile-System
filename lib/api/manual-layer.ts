/**
 * Self-edit v1 — the read-merge layer (#356; ADR-005 § read-merge).
 *
 * Two manual-override mechanisms are read here:
 *
 *  - `field_override` — human-entered data that survives every ETL rebuild; at
 *    read time it takes precedence over the ETL-managed column it shadows. v1
 *    runtime-merges exactly one field, `overview` (`getEffectiveOverview`) —
 *    hence a single function, not the generic `Merged<T>` machinery ADR-005
 *    anticipates; that generalization earns its ceremony only once a second
 *    field is runtime-merged. (`slug` is override-able too, but a slug override
 *    is consumed by `etl/ed`, not merged at runtime.)
 *
 *  - `suppression` — whole-publication takedowns and per-author hides, applied
 *    as a query-time predicate (`loadPublicationSuppressions` + `isAuthorHidden`
 *    + `isPublicationDark`). `Suppression` has no FK / Prisma relation to
 *    `Publication` or `PublicationAuthor` (ADR-005 § Keying — a suppression row
 *    must be able to outlive a hard-deleted target), so it cannot be a nested
 *    Prisma `where`; it is loaded per request, scoped to the pmids in hand, and
 *    applied in code.
