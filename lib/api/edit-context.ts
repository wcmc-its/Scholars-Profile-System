/**
 * Self-edit v1 — suppression-OFF read for the `/edit` self surface (#356,
 * `self-edit-spec.md` § Surfaces "read the target record with the suppression
 * filter OFF", § Hide a publication; UI-SPEC § `/edit` — the self-edit surface).
 *
 * One server call loads everything the page renders: the scholar's identity +
 * effective bio, the visibility-card state (own / admin / both), and the
 * confirmed authorship list annotated per UI-SPEC § Card 3 row-state table
 * (`shown` / `hidden_by_self` / `removed_by_admin`) plus the sole-displayed-
 * author flag that drives the sole-author confirm dialog (UI-SPEC edge case 11).
 *
 * #160 UI follow-up (`self-edit-launch-spec.md`): the same call also loads the
 * scholar's active appointments, all education, and all grants — each keyed on
 * its stable `externalId` (#352) and annotated with the shared four-state row
 * model (`shown` / `hidden_by_self` / `hidden_by_admin` / `locked`) the new
 * Appointments / Education / Funding panels render. The write-path (suppress /
 * revoke) is unchanged — PR-A #480 / PR-B #482 shipped it; this is the read.
 *
 * Suppression-OFF means: the lookup does not filter `scholar.status='active'`,
 * so a self- or admin-suppressed scholar can still load `/edit` and revoke. The
 * helper still returns `null` when no scholar row exists, or when the row is
 * soft-deleted (`deletedAt` set) — a departed scholar has nothing to edit.
 *
 * Phase 3 / Phase 6 scope (D6.1) — `self-edit-v1-implementation-plan.md` § Phase
 * 3 lists this file as a Phase 3 deliverable; PR #385 shipped only the overview
 * read-merge. Phase 6 absorbs it because Phase 6 is the only v1 consumer.
 *
 * Server-only by construction (uses Prisma) — no explicit `server-only` import
 * so the module loads under vitest without a stub, matching `manual-layer.ts`.
