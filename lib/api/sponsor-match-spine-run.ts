/**
 * Sponsor-match searchPeople SPINE — impure per-term composition
 * (pivot handoff `docs/2026-07-11-sponsor-match-searchpeople-pivot-handoff.md`
 * §4/§6). The pure helpers stay in `sponsor-match-spine.ts` (extraction, RRF)
 * and `sponsor-match-axes.ts` (clustering); THIS module owns the
 * side-effecting glue the bake-off runs behind `SPONSOR_MATCH_SPINE`:
 *
 *   paste ─▶ extractSponsorConcepts (Bedrock LLM: concepts + centrality; dictionary
 *            `extractTerms` fallback on outage) ─▶ per-term matchQueryToTaxonomy (MeSH)
 *         ─▶ mergeTermClusters (dedup redundant phrasing)
 *         ─▶ per-cluster searchPeople (topical-only: faculty/grant prominence OFF)
 *         ─▶ weight = centrality^γ × kindPrior ─▶ rrfFuse(rank) ─▶ top-N
 *
 * Contrast with the bespoke `rankResearchersForDescription`: that path is ONE
 * BM25 round-trip over the whole paste × Variant-B; this path decomposes the
 * paste into concepts and fuses per-concept people rankings on RANK (the
 * `searchPeople` BM25 scores are query-scaled and NOT cross-comparable). The two
 * engines run side-by-side on the same deploy so the offline eval can score
 * ORDER; nothing here is wired live until the sub-flag flips.
 *
 * EXTRACTION: the Bedrock LLM front-end `extractSponsorConcepts` (§7-Q1) is the
 * primary term source — it reads the prose and names canonical research concepts
 * `matchQueryToTaxonomy` can resolve, each with a real per-term CENTRALITY. It
 * replaced the v1 dictionary `extractTerms` after a staging bake-off measured the
 * dictionary at ~0 recall on real pastes (it only literal-matches `Topic`/`Subtopic`
 * labels, so paraphrase / brand-name / un-catalogued prose is missed). The dictionary
 * is KEPT as a fallback: when the LLM returns [] (Bedrock outage/empty), the spine
 * extracts with `extractTerms` over the taxonomy-label vocab at UNIFORM_CENTRALITY —
 * degrading to v1 recall rather than to nothing. Both empty ⇒ [] (unchanged).
 *
 * CENTRALITY: real 0-1 values from the LLM (uniform 1.0 only on the dictionary
 * fallback). It is the LIVE left factor of the fusion weight (`centrality × idf`), so
 * differentiated centrality reorders results and gives the editable-centrality UI a
 * signal to edit.

/**
 * NO DEFAULT TRUNCATION — the candidate universe shipped to the client is the FULL fused
 * pool, not a top-N of it. This is load-bearing for the re-rank contract, and it is subtle.
 *
 * The client re-ranks over exactly the candidates it was sent. If the server truncated to the
 * top-N *at default weights*, then sliding a concept UP could not surface that concept's own
 * best people — they were cut before the response was written. Concretely: a paste yields a
 * dominant concept A (weight 7.2) and a secondary concept B (weight 1.6). A's people fill the
 * entire default top-100 — A's rank-100 scores 7.2/(60+100) = .045, which still beats B's
 * rank-1 at 1.6/(60+1) = .026 — so B's single best researcher is not in the payload at all.
 * The officer then drags A to zero precisely to isolate B, and the rail shows leftover
 * A-people who happen to rank weakly under B, with B's actual expert missing. The one
 * interaction the sliders exist for would be the one that silently breaks.
 *
 * (#1673 did not have this bug — it re-queried the server on every drag, which is the very
 * thing the contract forbids. Dropping the re-query means the PAYLOAD must carry the pool
 * that the re-query would have re-fused.)
 *
 * Shipping the whole pool makes the client re-rank EQUIVALENT to a server re-fusion at the
 * edited weights, for ANY weights — the property the contract actually promises.
 *
 * The pool is bounded by construction: MAX_TERMS (8) × TERM_DEPTH (100) = 800 candidates
 * worst-case, and far fewer in practice once clusters merge and their people overlap. The
 * panel renders only the top slice of the current ranking, so the DOM does not grow with it.
 * `opts.limit` still truncates for callers that genuinely want a top-N — but the route does
 * NOT pass it, because a truncated pool is a broken rail.

 * diseases and a methods paste promotes its methods, from one rule with no special-casing.
 * (A BLANKET "disease outranks method" rule would break every paste where the method IS the
 * target — FINDING §9's objection, which paste-relativity answers.)
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES, measured — and it is not what #1676 claimed. That comment justified
 * the prior as protecting the method-target pastes ("ml-in-medicine, single-cell-genomics —
 * measured, not hypothetical"). Re-fusing every fixture from a FIXED extraction, with only
 * the prior varying, says otherwise: on ml-in-medicine it changes nDCG by exactly 0.000, and
 * on single-cell-genomics it is mildly HARMFUL (+0.010 when removed). Its whole positive value
 * comes from DISEASE pastes carrying one stray `method` concept — immuno-onc (-0.093 without
 * it) and heme-malignancy (-0.066) — where damping that stray is what helps.
 *
 * So it earns its keep (removing it costs -0.007 mean over 15 fixtures) by suppressing the
 * off-target concept in a single-target paste, NOT by defending method pastes. It also cannot
 * do anything at all on the 7 of 15 fixtures whose concepts are all one kind: there it is a

    // EXACTLY the budget the OpenSearch parent circuit breaker polices, and it is why

    // of this did and which inverts the cap in the common case:
    //
    //   γ=3 means centrality DOMINATES rank, and the anti-correlation runs the wrong way. A
    //   sponsor's PRIMARY concept is its broadest, most competitive query, so a specialist
    //   ranks WORSE on it than on some narrow peripheral mechanism. With the real constants
    //   (K=30, aligned 1.25, off-target 0.8):
    //
    //     target    (centrality 1.0, aligned)     weight 1.25 → 1.25/(30+25) = 0.0227
    //     mechanism (centrality 0.5, off-target)  weight 0.10 → 0.10/(30+1)  = 0.0032
    //
    //   A rank cap keeps the mechanism at rank 1 and DROPS the target at rank 25 — slicing off
    //   the concept the card leads with as its first chip. The blocks would then contradict the
    //   chips beside them, which is precisely the failure the derived-not-wired chips exist to
    //   prevent.

    // would spend its three slots on concepts that ship nothing and leave the card blank while
    // real evidence sat unused in the map. (It also repairs a narrower loss in the old best-only
