/**
 * Self-edit v1 / B03 — the append-only audit write (#102, #354;
 * `docs/b03-audit-log.md`).
 *
 * Every successful `/api/edit/*` write — a field override, a suppression
 * create, or a suppression revoke — appends exactly one row to
 * `scholars_audit.manual_edit_audit`, inside the **same transaction** as the
 * manual-layer write it audits. The table is deliberately not a Prisma model:
 * keeping it out of the ORM means `UPDATE` / `DELETE` against an audit row are
 * not expressible in application code at all. The insert is a parameterized
 * `$executeRaw` against the fully-qualified name; the application role is
 * granted `INSERT` and nothing else (`scripts/sql/audit-log.sql`).
 *
 * `row_hash` is row-level tamper-evidence (#102): a SHA-256 over a **canonical**
 * JSON serialization of the row (`docs/b03-audit-log.md` § row_hash) — a
 * positional array whose nested objects have their keys sorted recursively, so
 * the digest is independent of object-key order. That matters because MySQL
 * `JSON` columns re-sort object keys on storage: hashing insertion-order JSON
 * would leave a row un-verifiable from its own stored columns. `id` is excluded
 * — the DB assigns it after the hash.
